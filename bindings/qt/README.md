# qzwebrap

## Overview

qzwebrap is a Qt wrapper for zwebrap. It's possible to link
statically or dynamically against it as well as use it as internal or external
library.

## Internal library

You can use the Qt wrapper as internal library by including the
`qzwebrap.pri` file. Here is a minimal example app:

```make
QT += core
QT -= gui

include(<path to pri file>/qzwebrap.pri)

CONFIG   += console
CONFIG   -= app_bundle

TEMPLATE = app

SOURCES += main.cpp
```

To link statically against the wrapper you need to change the
`QZWEBRAP_LIBRARY` variable in `config.pri` to `no`.

To link dynamically against the wrapper you need to change the
`QZWEBRAP_LIBRARY` variable in `config.pri` to `yes`.

## External library

To install qzwebrap as a shared library do the following:

```sh
qmake
make
sudo make install
```

The default installation directory prefix on unix is `/usr/local/`. If you like
to change the prefix define the PREFIX variable when calling qmake.

```sh
qmake PREFIX=/usr
```
```

## Notes

If you're missing some methods in the bindings then because they have been
excluded. Currently methods are excluded if,

    * they have variadic arguments and don't have a sibling method that
      accepts a va_list. Most prominent example is probably printf and vprintf.

    * they have char** arguments, as they might get freed which doesn't play
      well with QString.
