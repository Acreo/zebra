# zwebrap - REST/HTTP to XRAP gateway.

.toc 3

## Overview

zwebrap is a REST/HTTP to XRAP gateway.

### Scope and Goals

zwebrap is designed to take HTTP request for the common HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. It will convert these HTTP request into the XRAP format and pass it on to the request handlers which compose a response in the XRAP format which will be converted back into HTTP.
