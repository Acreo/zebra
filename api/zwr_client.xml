<class name = "zwr_client">
    ZWebRap Client

    <include filename = "../license.xml" />

    <constructor>
        Create a new zwr_client, return the reference if successful, or NULL
        if construction failed due to lack of available memory.
    </constructor>

    <destructor>
        Destroy the zwr_client and free all memory used by the object.
    </destructor>

    <method name = "actor">
        Return actor, when caller wants to work with multiple actors and/or
        input sockets asynchronously.
        <return type = "zactor" />
    </method>

    <method name = "msgpipe">
        Return message pipe for asynchronous message I/O. In the high-volume case,
        we send methods and get replies to the actor, in a synchronous manner, and
        we send/recv high volume message data to a second pipe, the msgpipe. In
        the low-volume case we can do everything over the actor pipe, if traffic
        is never ambiguous.
        <return type = "zsock" />
    </method>

    <method name = "connected">
        Return true if client is currently connected, else false. Note that the
        client will automatically re-connect if the server dies and restarts after
        a successful first connection.
        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "connect">
        Connect to server endpoint, with specified timeout in msecs (zero means wait
        forever). Constructor succeeds if connection is successful. The caller may
        specify its address.
        Returns >= 0 if successful, -1 if interrupted.

    <method  name = "set handler">
        Offer to handle particular XRAP requests, where the route matches request's
        resource.

    </method>

    <method name = "deliver">
        Send XRAP DELIVER message to server, takes ownership of message
        and destroys message when done sending it.

        Receive message from server; caller destroys message when done
        <return type = "zmsg" />
